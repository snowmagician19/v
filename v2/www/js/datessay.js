	"Exploring 
The Spirit and Soul 
of the Gypsy
Through
Their Music and History


	
	The Gypsy is defined as an ethnically nomanic tribe group of which originates from the Middle English gypcian, short for Egipcien.  It is ultimately derived, via Middle French and Latin, from the Greek Αἰγύπτιοι (Aigyptioi), in other words, "Egyptians"; cf. Greek γύφτοι (gýftoi), which is a corruption of the same word.  It was once believed that the Romanies, or some other Gypsy groups, such as the Balkan Egyptians, originated in Egypt, and were exiled as a punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant Jesus.  The Oxford English Dictionary states that a 'Gypsy' is of Indian origin, which first appeared in England about the beginning of the 16th century. [Wikipedia]  Over a span of one millennium, Gypsies moved to Europe from Northern India.  Many people are commonly aware that the Gypsy tribe do not have a fixed or specific residence.  They endlessly travel from country to country.  They enjoy playing their own unique genre of music, and the particular music genre of their own, is their valuable property.  The music they play is beautiful, powerful, lovely and memorable, and it is basically a religion for them.  It is their method of communication to express what is in their hearts, their truth and their deepest emotions.  In the documentary titled  “Latcho Drom”, the journey of the Gypsy tribe was introduced, and the excellent film effectively displayed their cultural music and dance.  Since the beginning of their history, they continuously played beautiful music with various types of instruments and danced.  This genre of music has been adapted in a variety of other regions, while its historical and fundamental heritage was properly maintained and stayed intact.  It creates vocalization and sends it to the listeners' hearts, and also creates expression of emotion from the deepest rest of the soul.  I was not familiar with the genre of the Gypsy music, but at my ethnomusicology class at Humber College, I have had chances to learn about the Gypsy music genre, and I am amazed by its greatness in the process.  The objective of this research is to investigate and learn about the Gypsy culture and how the history influenced the style of this particular music genre.
	For this particular research, I first decided to ask around if there is any famous Gypsy music band in the Greater Toronto Area, and a very good friend of mine, named Kevin, highly recommended the band named “The Gypsy Rebels”.  When I typed in “Gypsy Music in Toronto” on the Google search engine, the first result returned was “the Lemon Bucket Orkestra”.  I attempted to contact the Lemon Bucket Orkestra.  However, it was very hard for me to make an appointment with the band.               The second result provided by the Google search engine was “The Gypsy Rebels”, located at http://www.thegypsyrebels.com.  When I paid a visit to the band's official website, I came to the realization that I finally found a very skilled and profoundly cultural Gypsy band in Toronto.  I was very pleased that I finally found someone who can also help me learn more about the Gypsy people's music and their culture more effectively than anyone else in the Greater Toronto Area.   I was amazed to learn that the founder of the Gypsy Rebels is the first musician ever to bring the Gypsy style music from his own country.  His name was Micheal T.  Butch, a man of Gypsy heritage.  In the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada, Micheal T Butch is arguably one of the most advanced and experienced Gypsy musicians.  He is most famous for his Gypsy jazz style music, and is the founder of his band, the Gypsy Rebels, based in Toronto.  I found his contact information on the Gypsy Rebels' official website, and gave him a phone call.   He and I discussed and chose an appropriate place for the interview.   During our phone conversation, I was glad to realize that he definitely enjoys discussing his music and the Gypsy culture with anyone who is interested.  I was hoping to get sufficient amounts of information about the Gypsy tribe’s history,  music and culture, and most importantly, its soul and spirit.  As I expected, he was a very kind person who was certainly willing to provide me with sufficient information I was seeking for this research.  While I was preparing the questionnaire for Mr.  Micheal T.  Butch on the topic of the Gypsy music, I did not expect that this interview would quickly give me such a significant and deep insight regarding the Gypsy music, culture and history.   
	I decided to use my smartphone to record the interview with Micheal.  After I completed the questionnaire for Micheal T.  Butch and the equipment that I will be using during the interview, I was on my way to a restaurant near Dundas Square area near Ryerson University, Toronto.  I made sure I had my smartphone with me to record the interview, and also made sure that the battery of my smartphone was fully charged.  When I was preparing the questions I will have for Mr. Butch about the Gypsy music and culture, I had no idea that this interview would give me a much greater and deeper insight and appreciation for the Gypsy music and culture than I was expecting to receive.  I was definitely ready to gain very detailed information on the history, culture and music style of the Gypsy tribe.  When I finally met Mr.  Micheal T.  Butch for the first time, his beautiful blue eyes and his fedora hat came to my attention.  I was very grateful for, and honoured to receive, his generous assistance for my research on Gypsy music.  We were then on our way to his studio for the actual interview.  My first impression on Micheal T.  Butch was very unique.  It was definitely pleasant, but slightly abnormal, albeit certainly not in a bad way.  The way he would never hesitate to dance on the street whenever he heard beautiful music, the way he dressed, and the way he talked, and situations where he would stay silent until we arrived at his studio were all unique and surprising experiences that I rarely had in the past.  Upon arriving at his studio, I started off my interview with some questions about his background information.  And he kindly explained to me his background ancestral lines, how he came to Canada, and the basic history of the Gypsy tribe.   

	First, he provided me with his knowledge about his ancestors, that they were performers for the Zār.  Zār or Zaar is a religious custom, originating in central Ethiopia during the 18the century, later spreading througout East and North Africa.[ Natvig, 1998 ]  His ancestors played the custom Gypsy music with his great great grandfather playing the guitar and instruments while his great great grandmother danced and sang.  Due to the fact that they were entertainers for the Zār, they were treated with more courtesy and respect in Russia.  This was a very unusual case for a Gypsy family, because “The majority of Gypsies lived mostly in poverty and living in very harsh conditions.”                 [ Butch, 2014 ] However, the Zār, because of their music, enjoyed the performances by these Gypsy musicians.  He went on to mention that his ancestors moved to the United States of America, and while his ancestors were living there, they learned that Canada was offering great benefits such as free land and various types of opportunities to experienced farmers.  His family decided to take advantage of this opportunity, because they indeed were experienced farmers who used to make horseshoes out of metals.  They already had the expertise, because prior to the Butch family becoming entertainers for the Zār, for years and years the family was farming, raising animals and growing crops for that’s all they did, which was to travel and wheat off the land.  Mr.  Butch mentioned that the reason why they had to do this was “A lot of people did not want Gypsies roaming in their local cities and towns” [ Butch, 2014 ] and so they needed to continue travelling to different lands.  And to make money, they routinely threw parties and provided entertainments for the people in town to see them perform.  Consequently, out of this extraordinary hierarchy and family history, I was able to grasp three main focal points in the typical Gypsy lifestyle.  Firstly, their music was highly respected, and secondly, they had difficulty making livings at times even if their music was highly regarded, and lastly, they were constant travellers.  While reviewing the Gypsy Rebels' excellent music, I naturally started to wonder what made their music so special, unique and versatile.  What are the specific traits of the music composed and performed by the less fortunate, constantly travelling group of people, that it has made such a great impact to the world?  What are the primary concepts of this genre of music?  Where did it come from?  How are they being played? And how have they transformed and survived?  A variety of additional and important questions arose during the interview with the opening of Mr. Butch’s exciting background story.  The story about his original family name, which was Butchski, originated from Russia making its change to Butch in coming into North America was a fond evidence about the transformation in its culture.  Alongside with that, the Gypsy music had also transformed throughout the Gypsy’s journeys from India to Egypt to Europe.  Mr.  Butch then led me into his perspective about the Gypsy music.  He mentioned the young virtuosic Gypsy musicians, who have no basic training of the musical instruments, but play the instrument and as he says it, “Making it happen.” Most of the Gypsy instrumentalists are self-taught, who have no idea about the music theory.  They would rather go for the soul and energy of the music, exemplifying their passion.  Unlike the Western Art Music developed in Europe, the Gypsies, who were found in Europe, were not trained by literature.  Unlike classically trained virtuosity of the west, they had the aurally trained virtuosity of the west.  This musical difference is reflecting the cultural differences in the same geographic area.  Although Europe was more of a land of literature, almost like Africans, the Gypsies did not need the literature, nor practiced it, but aurally transferred their learning and taught themselves.  The way the Gypsies played music was definitely different from classical music.  Even the places where they played music were greatly different.  In comparison to the western classical music, classical music was performed in churches and concert halls in front of audience.  The performer was being highlighted, and audiences were to be quiet while the concert is going on.  However, it is very different with Gypsy people.  The Gypsy music is frequently played in campfire settings, usually outdoor, and there is no form or custody to their performances.  It is rather unorganized and unplanned.  The music is frequently performed in parties, and it is not about who the most superior musician is.  The music is more of a custom to their party-like settings, rather than a competition to decide upon the “Final winner”.  And another thing is that music is in control of the campfire party.  Although alcohol and cigarettes are sometimes involved with the whole scene, these are not even close to being the main enjoyment of the party.  The Gypsy parties are driven by music, not alcohol or cigarettes, because people are there to enjoy music along with their singing, dancing and playing instruments.  In comparison to the normal European culture, the Gypsies have more of the “Carpe diem” in their lifestyle, which means, “Seize the day” in Latin.[ Butch, 2014 ]  It is not about achieving something, nor is it about getting better.  It is certainly not about defeating others.  It is about the enjoying the moment.  The Gypsy culture, as well as its music is moment driven.  Their music is very instantaneous, and it emphasizes the happiness of “now”, or the “moment” rather than possible happiness in the future.  I reminded myself of my first impression of Mr. Butch, when we were walking past the busker, how he situated himself to stop and sing and dance with the busker on the street, and enjoying the moment, seizing the day.  Most genres of the classical and modern music are, just like many types of cultures, goal-driven and result-driven.  There is a high point of the tune, a climax, which the music builds up to.  Also, the emphasis on “Perfect harmony” always accompanies.  It waits and waits till it reaches its peak.  But in the Gypsy music, it is more of enjoying the ride, a journey, and the musicians and audience have a wonderful time together, rather than going for a specific destination it is reaching to.  In other words, it is more about enjoying the actual process of arriving at the destination, rather than the destination itself.  The Gypsy parties that normally break out without any plans can be a great example.  The Gypsy music being played mostly at “parties” is very different from concerts that are carefully planned about 2 months ahead of the actual date of the concert.  It also differs from Church services.  Mr.  Butch gave it a very clear explanation by using an example scenario.  “ Oh it's a nice day today.  Let’s get a case of beer.  Let’s call Jim and play music.  Let’s call this person, that person.  The next thing you know, there’s a party. ”  As far as music being custom rather than competition goes, as a party breaks out and everyone is dancing and singing, all kinds of Gypsy songs come out.  One sings this song then the other sings another tune in response to the previous song out of respect.  This trading of entertainment would correspond to the “call and response” music culture from Africa, which is a similarity I found between the Gypsy music and the African music.  I have found the call and response culture of the Gypsies, instantaneous parties, and moment driving elements in their lifestyles.  These cultural aspects were perceived by me as a relation and connection to the African music’s elements.  And the Gypsy music certainly does show these elements in their music as well.  Firstly, the “call and response” style can be shown in their music with trading solos.  The instantaneous part comes in with solos and vocals.   At Mr.  Butch’s studio, I had a privilege to enjoy a Gypsy jam and a guitar duo live.   There were significant amounts of improvisation in the tunes, and mostly the music was not organized the way classical music is organized.  And the moment driving element can be seen with the repetition of forms.  The tunes were mostly made up of simple, popular chords that kept on repeating themselves.  As a jazz musician, I was able to listen to Mr.  Butch’s playing a tune and immediately play on top of him, because the tune was keep on repeating the same parts over and over again.  When I assembled these elements together to form the basic foundation of Gypsy music, I was able to see that their harmonic sense was much derived from the countries that the Gypsies frequently traveled to.  For example, the harmony of Gypsy was very much close to that of Russian and Jewish Klezmir music, where there was a lot of minor tonality.   During the interview with Mr.  Butch, he asked me what the first chord I ever learned when I started playing instruments.  I answered that it is the C Major.   He responded, “That means you went with the Do.  You went with Do Re Mi Fa Sol Ra Ti Do.  When my father brought me a mandolin when I was 10 years old, and the first chord he showed me was an A minor.  And then the next day, he made me strum it, and the second day he showed me a D minor.  And then, the third day he showed me an E.  You can probably play one hundred Gypsy songs with these three chords.”.  Through this interview session, I was able to learn the difference between the classical harmony and Gypsy harmony.  The Gypsies were favouring the minor keys rather than major keys.  Consequently, in most of their tunes, the songs will begin with a minor chord, and end on a minor chord.  Also, the most basic chords used in Gypsy music are Imi, IVmi, and V7.  In a way, these three chords are the chords seen in a minor blues form.  So I saw the simplicity of harmony in Gypsy music, as well as some relation of the African influence once more.  On the transcribed sheet, there’s an example of Gypsy music, played by Micheal T.  Butch, using only 3 chords as mentioned above.  In essence, Mr.  Butch has taught me the significance of the minor key in Gypsy music and its influence.  He asked me what chord I would play the moment I grab a guitar.  I said I would play an E major chord.   He said that he would play an A minor to see if he is in tune or not.  So it showed me the importance and influence of minor tonality in the Gypsy music.  I was able to learn that this minor tonality was remarkably similar to that of Russian music, so I asked if he could demonstrate by playing these tunes.  He kindly picked up his guitar to demonstrate.  And while he was getting ready to play his guitar, it came to my realization that his guitar was clearly out of shape.  Many parts of the guitar were damaged and it looked like a cheap guitar.  As he was tuning, he jokingly said to me “Now this is what Gypsies don’t do, they tune.” It might have been a very simple and rather playful statement, but it contained a very profound characteristic of the Gypsy music - it is not about the perfectness of pitch they were concerned about, but it was about the soulfulness of the music.  And then he played me a tune called “Dark Eyes”, which was a traditional Russian tune.  And after that, he played me a Gypsy tune called “Baby I love you”.  In comparison, they were both sounding very similar with the usage of harmonic minor.  Now, in our culture, harmonic minor or the minor tonality itself gives the music a feeling of despair, sadness and regret.  So, I was wondering if that maybe the same case for the Gypsies who are born to adapt to this kind of music at such a young age.  Because Mr.  Butch was singing these tunes, I have asked for translations to what he was singing, so that I can see what mood these lyrics are in too.  Mr.  Butch spoke the translated version of a song he sung for me, playing chords to each phrase of the melody.  As much as this music sounded gloomy to my ears, the lyrics had a very much dark mood as well.  He told me about the early marriage traditions of the Gypsy culture, and the reason why they had a tendency to get married at relatively early stages of their lives.  There were many reasons for it : First, they were always being driven out of towns ; secondly, they had to keep their race together ; and lastly, there always was a possibility of them being separated from each other and the Holocaust during the Second World War took away the lives of a number of the members of the Gypsy tribe.  Marriages are a part of the natural and conventional requirements of reproduction and the Gypsy tribe wanted to speed up the process of reproduction by getting married and starting families early.  They kept trying to have children at early stages of their lives in order to keep their bloodline going, increase in numbers and maintain their traditions.  Then I realized that the gloomy minor chords do reflect the mood of their history.  Throughout their history, the Gypsy people kept being driven out of towns and many of their people suffered murders during the Holocaust.  Because the land they resided in at one point was Europe, which considers the minor sound as dark sound, Gypsies must have had at least some influence from the land they were residing in, considering these sounds that would not be felt dark at all in India or Egypt to be dark.

	When I was about to end the interview session and leave, I asked my new very good friend,  Mr. Michael T. Butch of the Gypsy Rebels, my last question for the day, which was about the instrumentation of this genre of music.  He answered that his band, the Gypsy Rebels, was formed with the traditional Romanian Gypsy instruments, such as guitar, bass, violin, accordion and many more kinds.  He gave me a kind explanation of the role of each and every type of instrument.  Firstly, the Gypsy music describes a story to the audience, which is why there is always a vocalist in the presence while they are performing on stage.  And then, there is a guitarist who is in charge of the rhythm which focuses on the beat and upright sound of the bass.  Additionally, an accordion and a violin which lead and make calls and responses.  Also, the Gypsy Rebels include a trumpeter who definitely makes great contributions to the band's exquisite music.  Mr.  Butch added that the involvement of a trumpeter was caused by the influence of Hungarian Gypsy music which contain horn sections.  

	In conclusion of this research, and gathering, analyzing and organizing the information kindly provided by Mr. Michael T Butch during the interview session, I learned to clearly see the historical transformation of Gypsy tribe and their music over its history.  The struggles of his ancestors and current generation, their never ending journey in search for a place where they can finally settle down peacefully, and the apparent rejections and ridicules by other groups of people around them were all recognized and thoroughly contained in their culture and music.  Their journey from India, through Egypt, to Europe, helped them grow their own energy and shape their pursuits which motivate them to always have hope, and never give up.  The amazing, closely connected and important relation between the Klezmir and Russian music let us learn the tragedy caused by the Holocaust and the Nazi army during the Second World War, which forced them to leave and endlessly travel around different areas, all over the world.  Their historical circumstances and situation motivated them to form their own means of enjoying the moment, and their adaptation to their difficult circumstances with the means of enjoying the music is shown through their culture and lifestyle, which as well is shown through their despair for not having a destination or a studio.   Wanting to rest, but always burdened.  Desiring to settle down in a location, but always travelling.  Roaming through this place called earth, searching for our true home, our ancestry, our roots, our soul and ourselves.  Yes it has always been difficult for the Gypsy tribe, and still is very difficult, but they will never abandon the hope that they will someday find our security and a beautiful land of their own to permanently and happily settle down in.  Until the beautiful day when all of their desires do come true, they will enjoy the ride, and all those spontaneous moments in their lives.  In the world of the Gypsy culture, it is about the moment and process, rather than the “destination” or the “result”.  Their history is saturated with endless travelling and unfortunate events which caused enormous suffering and deaths for their tribe, and listening to their music is one of very effective ways to feel the Gypsy soul and spirit.  Yes, books and historical records can definitely help one learn, but the Gypsy people's music magically send messages that can never be communicated in words.  That is one of the beauties of any music.  It can sometimes communicate, what can never be communicated in words.  Their culture and beautiful music style are shaped by their historical circumstances, which were the direct factors that led the Gypsy tribe to form a possibly sad, but very unique and beautiful music genre.    Mr. Micheal T. Butch has my sincere and deepest appreciation for his kind participation and assistance in the process of completing this research.
